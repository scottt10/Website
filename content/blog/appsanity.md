## Recon

### Nmap:

As always start with port scanning of AppSanity using nmap:

```python
kali Hard/AppSanity Â» sudo nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.238 -vv -p- --min-rate 5000  -oN nmap/initial 
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.238 (10.10.11.238)
Host is up, received echo-reply ttl 127 (0.28s latency).
Scanned at 2024-03-08 20:56:40 +0545 for 130s

# Nmap done at Fri Mar  8 20:58:50 2024 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 130.73 seconds
```

The nmap result listed out the different ports i.e 80, 443 and 7680.

The TCP Port 80 didnot follow redirection. So adding `meddigi.htb` at /etc/hosts.
